;;; early-init.el --- Emacs 27+ pre-initialisation config -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
;;; Commentary:

;;; Code:

;; A big contributor to startup times is garbage collection. We up the gc
;; threshold to temporarily prevent it from running, and then reset it by the
;; `gcmh' package.
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum
      gc-cons-percentage 0.6)

;; Increase how much is read from processes in a single chunk (default is 4kb).
;; `lsp-mode' benefits from that.
(setq read-process-output-max (* 4 1024 1024))

;; 关闭 Native Compilation 特性
;; Prevent unwanted runtime compilation for gccemacs (native-comp) users;
;; packages are compiled ahead-of-time when they are installed and site files
;; are compiled when gccemacs is installed.
(setq native-comp-deferred-compilation nil ;; obsolete since 29.1
      native-comp-jit-compilation nil);; Package initialize occurs automatically, before `user-init-file' is

;; loaded, but after `early-init-file'. We handle package
;; initialization, so we must prevent Emacs from doing it early!
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; In noninteractive sessions, prioritize non-byte-compiled source files to
;; prevent the use of stale byte-code. Otherwise, it saves us a little IO time
;; to skip the mtime checks on every *.elc file.
(setq load-prefer-newer noninteractive)

;; Explicitly set the prefered coding systems to avoid annoying prompt
;; from emacs (especially on Microsoft Windows)
(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)

;; Resizing the Emacs frame can be a terribly expensive part of changing the
;; font. By inhibiting this, we easily halve startup times with fonts that are
;; larger than the system default.
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)

;; Faster to disable these here (before they've been initialized)
(push '(menu-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
(push '(tool-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
(push '(vertical-scroll-bars) default-frame-alist)
